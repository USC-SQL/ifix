# IFix: A Tool for the Automated Repair of Internationalization Presentation Failures (IPFs)

Internationalization enables companies to reach a global audience by adapting their websites to locale specific language and content. However, such translations can often introduce Internationalization Presentation Failures (IPFs) --- distortions in the intended appearance of a website. It is challenging for developers to design websites that can inherently adapt to varying lengths of text from different languages. Debugging and repairing IPFs is complicated by the large number of HTML elements and CSS properties that define a web pageâ€™s appearance. Tool support is also limited as existing techniques can only detect IPFs, with the repair remaining a labor intensive manual task. To address this problem, we propose, *IFix*, a search-based technique for automatically repairing IPFs in web applications. More algorithmic details of IFix can be found in our paper:
